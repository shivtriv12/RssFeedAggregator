# RSS Feed Aggregator

A command-line tool that aggregates posts from RSS feeds you follow. Stay updated with content from multiple sources in one place.

## Prerequisites

Before using RSS Feed Aggregator, ensure you have:

- **Go** (version 1.16 or newer): [Install Go](https://golang.org/doc/install)
- **PostgreSQL** (version 12 or newer): [Install PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/)

## Installation

Install the RSS Feed Aggregator CLI using Go:

```bash
# Install directly from GitHub
go install github.com/shivtriv12/RSSFeedAggregator@latest

# Or clone and install locally
git clone https://github.com/shivtriv12/RSSFeedAggregator.git
cd RSSFeedAggregator
go install .
```

## Database Setup

1. Create a PostgreSQL database for the application:

```bash
# Login to PostgreSQL
sudo -u postgres psql

# Create the database
CREATE DATABASE gator;

# Exit PostgreSQL
\q
```

2. Run the database migrations (included in the repository):

```bash
cd RSSFeedAggregator
go get github.com/pressly/goose/v3/cmd/goose
goose -dir sql/schema postgres "postgres://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/gator" up
```

## Configuration

On first run, the application will create a config file at `~/.gatorconfig.json`. You can manually edit this file to change your database connection:

```json
{
  "db_url": "postgres://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/gator?sslmode=disable",
  "current_user_name": ""
}
```
